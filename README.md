Dear women who post nudes on reddit:

Stop with the fucking " I bet you'll never guess what's under my dress.."

It's tits. It's always fucking tits.

This is no mystery to anyone, and human anatomy has been the same for over 100k years. Seriously, shut the fuck up. You all do this. Do you really think your tits and asshole are so special that they're going to shift our collective consciousness or something?

"I bet the guys at the gym wonder what's under my yoga pants."

I bet they already know, and if they fucking don't, maybe you shouldn't be at a kid gym for 4 year olds.
